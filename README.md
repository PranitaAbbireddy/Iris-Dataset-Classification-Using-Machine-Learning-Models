# Iris Dataset Classification Using Machine Learning Models
This project demonstrates the classification of the Iris dataset using various machine learning models and evaluates their performance based on precision, recall, and accuracy. The models include Logistic Regression, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Decision Tree Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

## Project Overview
The Iris dataset is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning and statistics. It contains 150 samples of iris flowers with four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal of this project is to classify the iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset used in this project includes:

- Features: Sepal length, Sepal width, Petal length, Petal width
- Target: Species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)

## Methodology
### Data Preparation: 
- Load the dataset and create a DataFrame.
- Split the dataset into training and test sets.

### Model Training:
- Train multiple models including Logistic Regression, SVC, Decision Tree Classifier, and Gradient Boosting Classifier on the training data.

### Model Evaluation:
- Evaluate each model's performance using precision, recall, and accuracy.
- Use a custom evaluation function to print or return these metrics.
  
### Prediction:
- Demonstrate how to make predictions using the trained Gradient Boosting Classifier.
